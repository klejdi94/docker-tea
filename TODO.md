# Docker Tea - Next Steps

This document outlines the tasks that should be completed to fully implement the Docker Tea project.

## Current Status

We have successfully set up:

- Project structure with Go modules
- Configuration package
- Basic UI components and layout
- Real Docker service implementation with proper API types
- README and documentation

## TODO

### Core Features

- [x] Implement real Docker API integration (fix compatibility issues with Docker API)
- [x] Implement container action handlers (start, stop, restart, pause, etc.)
- [x] Add container resource usage monitoring with graphs
- [x] Implement image management functions (remove, inspect)
- [x] Implement volume management functions (remove, inspect)
- [x] Implement network management functions (remove, inspect)
- [x] Add Docker Compose integration
- [x] Implement container creation interface
- [ ] Add search and filtering capabilities

### UI Enhancements

- [x] Add visual resource usage graphs/charts
- [x] Implement color themes and customization
- [x] Add tabbed interface for container logs
- [ ] Add progress indicators for long-running operations
